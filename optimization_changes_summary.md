   # Use optimized config
   cp src/config_optimized.json src/config.json

## Sources to Monitor

These sources had partial failures but are kept due to their value:
- **AI Business** (aibusiness.com) - 403 errors for reading time extraction
- **Crunchbase News** - 403 errors for reading time extraction  
- **Machine Learning Mastery** - 403 errors for reading time extraction

Basic RSS parsing works for these sources, but detailed content extraction may fail.
