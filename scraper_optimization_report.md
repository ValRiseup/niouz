   - **For AI Trends**: Consider "AI Time Journal" or "Towards Data Science"
   - **For Artificial Intelligence News**: Consider "AI News" by Analytics Insight

### Medium-Term Optimizations

3. **Review Partial Failures**
   - Monitor AI Business and Crunchbase News performance
   - Consider implementing retry logic with different user agents
   - Evaluate if basic RSS content is sufficient for these high-value sources

4. **Quality Rating Validation**
   - Cross-reference current quality ratings (1-5) with actual performance
   - Update ratings based on real-world scraping success rates
   - Consider weighted scoring: (Content Quality √ó Reliability √ó Accessibility)

### Technical Improvements

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Implement source-specific retry strategies
   - Add user-agent rotation for sources with 403 errors
   - Consider proxy rotation for heavily protected sources

6. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add source-level success rate tracking
   - Implement automated source health checks
   - Create alerts for sources dropping below performance thresholds

## Expected Impact of Optimizations

### Before Optimization
- **Total Sources**: 74
- **Reliable Sources**: ~68 (92%)
- **Completely Failed Sources**: 3 (4%)
- **Partial Issues**: 3 (4%)

### After Optimization
- **Total Sources**: 74 (remove 3, add 3 alternatives)
- **Expected Reliable Sources**: ~71 (96%)
- **Expected Article Quality**: Higher (removing noise from failed sources)
- **Scraping Efficiency**: Improved (less time wasted on failing sources)

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate - 1 day)
1. Remove the 3 completely failing sources from `src/config.json`
2. Test scraper with reduced source list
3. Validate improved success rate

### Phase 2 (Short-term - 1 week)
1. Research and add 3 replacement sources
2. Test new sources individually
3. Update source quality ratings based on performance data

### Phase 3 (Medium-term - 1 month)
1. Implement enhanced error handling
2. Add performance monitoring
3. Create automated source health dashboard

## Conclusion

The current sources list has a solid foundation with 92% of sources performing reliably. By removing the 3 completely failing sources and replacing them with better alternatives, we can achieve ~96% reliability while maintaining content diversity and quality.

The high-performing sources span all categories effectively, ensuring comprehensive AI news coverage. Focus should be on maintaining these reliable sources while continuously monitoring and optimizing the remaining ones.

**Next Steps**: Begin with Phase 1 implementation to see immediate improvement in scraper performance and data quality.
